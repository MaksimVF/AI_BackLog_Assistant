# Enhanced Agents Implementation

## Advanced Scoring Agents
The implementation includes enhanced versions of key scoring agents with advanced configuration:

### RICE/ICE Agent
- **Enhanced Features**:
  - Normalized reach calculation with configurable min/max
  - Impact anchors (tiny/low/medium/high/massive)
  - Risk adjustment (probability Ã— impact) with configurable penalty
  - Effort estimation with PERT
  - Categorization (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)

### WSJF Agent
- **Enhanced Features**:
  - Weighted calculation: (Business Value + Time Criticality + Risk Reduction) / Job Size
  - Configurable component weights
  - PERT-based effort estimation
  - Categorization (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)

### Kano Agent
- **Enhanced Features**:
  - Supports survey data (functional/dysfunctional pairs)
  - Heuristic fallback using satisfaction/dissatisfaction
  - Category detection (must-be, performance, attractive, etc.)
  - Configurable category weights
  - CS/DS index calculation

### MoSCoW Agent
- **Enhanced Features**:
  - Base classification (must/should/could/wont)
  - Adjustments for critical dependencies, deadlines, and capacity
  - Configurable boosts/penalties

## Example Configuration
```python
config = AnalysisConfig(
    methods=["RICE", "MOSCOW", "WSJF", "KANO"],
    weights={"RICE": 1.0, "MOSCOW": 0.8, "WSJF": 1.0, "KANO": 1.0},
    rice=RiceConfig(reach_min=0, reach_max=10000, risk_penalty=0.3),
    wsjf=WsjfConfig(min_score=1, max_score=10),
    kano=KanoConfig(weight_attractive=1.2),
    moscow=MoscowConfig(deadline_boost=0.15)
)
```

## Testing Results
All enhanced agents have been tested with comprehensive test cases, including:
- Basic functionality tests
- Risk adjustment scenarios
- Configuration parameter validation
- Integration with the orchestration system

## Integration
The enhanced agents are fully integrated with:
- The Level 2 orchestration system
- The aggregation framework
- The repository interface
- The API endpoints

This implementation provides advanced, configurable scoring capabilities that significantly enhance the prioritization accuracy and flexibility of the AI Backlog Assistant.
