# Enhanced Logging System for AI_BackLog_Assistant

## Overview

The enhanced logging system provides comprehensive logging capabilities including:

- **Structured logging** in JSON format for better parsing and analysis
- **Log rotation** to manage file sizes and prevent disk exhaustion
- **External integration** with ELK, Splunk, and HTTP endpoints
- **Contextual logging** for better traceability
- **Specialized logging** for metrics, audits, and health checks

## Features

### 1. Structured Logging

All logs are formatted as JSON with consistent fields:
- `timestamp`: ISO format timestamp
- `level`: Log level (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)
- `service`: Service name
- `environment`: Environment (dev/test/prod)
- `message`: Log message
- `logger`: Logger name
- `module`: Module name
- `function`: Function name
- `line`: Line number
- Additional context fields as needed

### 2. Log Rotation

Logs are automatically rotated when they reach a configurable size (default 10MB), with a configurable number of backup files (default 5).

### 3. External Integration

Supports sending logs to external systems:
- **ELK Stack** (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
- **Splunk**
- **HTTP endpoints** (generic webhooks)

### 4. Specialized Logging

Additional logging methods for specific use cases:
- **Metrics logging**: Track performance metrics with tags
- **Audit logging**: Track user actions and system changes
- **Health check logging**: Monitor service health

### 5. Dynamic Configuration

Logging configuration can be changed at runtime without restarting the application.

## Configuration

### Configuration File

The logging system can be configured via `config/logging_config.yaml`:

```yaml
service_name: "AI_BackLog_Assistant"
environment: "dev"  # Will be overridden by ENV variable
log_level: "INFO"
log_file: "logs/app.log"
max_bytes: 10485760  # 10MB
backup_count: 5

external_systems:
  # ELK configuration
  elk:
    host: "localhost:9200"
    index: "ai_backlog_logs"
    username: "elastic"
    password: "changeme"

  # Splunk configuration
  splunk:
    host: "localhost"
    port: 8089
    username: "admin"
    password: "changeme"
    index: "main"
    sourcetype: "_json"

  # HTTP logging configuration
  http:
    url: "https://logs.example.com/api/logs"
    headers:
      Content-Type: "application/json"
      Authorization: "Bearer token123"
    timeout: 5
```

### Environment Variables

- `ENV`: Sets the environment (dev/test/prod)
- `LOG_LEVEL`: Overrides the log level

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
from agents.system_admin.logging_manager import initialize_logging

# Initialize logging
logging_manager = initialize_logging(
    service_name="MyService",
    environment="dev",
    log_level="INFO"
)

# Get a logger
logger = logging_manager.get_logger()

# Log messages
logger.info("This is an informational message")
logger.warning("This is a warning message")
logger.error("This is an error message")
```

### Contextual Logging

```python
# Add context to logs
context_logger = logging_manager.add_context(
    user_id="12345",
    session_id="abcdef"
)
context_logger.info("User action with context")
```

### Specialized Logging

```python
# Log a metric
logging_manager.log_metric(
    "response_time",
    120.5,
    unit="ms",
    endpoint="/api/v1/health"
)

# Log an audit event
logging_manager.log_audit(
    "login",
    "user123",
    "auth_service",
    "success",
    ip_address="192.168.1.1"
)

# Log a health check
logging_manager.log_health_check(
    "database",
    "healthy",
    connection_time=5,
    query_time=2
)
```

### Dynamic Configuration

```python
# Change log level at runtime
logging_manager.set_log_level("DEBUG")

# Load configuration from file
logging_manager.load_config_from_file("config/custom_logging.yaml")
```

## Log Rotation and Archiving

### Automatic Rotation

Logs are automatically rotated when they reach the configured size. The system keeps a configurable number of backup files.

### Manual Archiving

```python
# Archive old log files
archived_files = logging_manager.archive_logs("log_archive")
print(f"Archived: {archived_files}")

# Clean up old logs
deleted_files = logging_manager.cleanup_old_logs(max_age_days=30)
print(f"Deleted: {deleted_files}")
```

## External System Integration

### ELK Integration

To enable ELK integration, install the Elasticsearch client:

```bash
pip install elasticsearch
```

Then configure the ELK section in the logging config.

### Splunk Integration

To enable Splunk integration, install the Splunk SDK:

```bash
pip install splunk-sdk
```

Then configure the Splunk section in the logging config.

### HTTP Integration

HTTP integration is available by default and can be configured in the logging config.

## Best Practices

1. **Use structured logging**: Always include relevant context in your logs
2. **Avoid sensitive data**: Don't log passwords, tokens, or PII
3. **Use appropriate log levels**: DEBUG for development, INFO for normal operation, WARNING/ERROR for issues
4. **Monitor log growth**: Configure appropriate rotation and retention policies
5. **Test external integrations**: Ensure external logging systems are working correctly

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Logs not appearing**: Check the log level and configuration
2. **External logging failing**: Check network connectivity and credentials
3. **High disk usage**: Adjust rotation settings or increase cleanup frequency
4. **Performance issues**: Consider asynchronous logging for high-volume systems

### Debugging

Enable debug logging to troubleshoot issues:

```python
logging_manager.set_log_level("DEBUG")
```

## Implementation Details

### Architecture

The logging system consists of:

1. **LoggingManager**: Main class that manages configuration and handlers
2. **EnhancedJSONFormatter**: Custom formatter for JSON output
3. **External handlers**: Specialized handlers for ELK, Splunk, HTTP
4. **Configuration system**: YAML-based configuration with environment overrides

### Thread Safety

The logging system is thread-safe and can be used in multi-threaded applications.

### Performance

For high-volume logging, consider:
- Using asynchronous handlers
- Batching logs for external systems
- Implementing log sampling for DEBUG level

## Future Enhancements

1. **Asynchronous logging**: Improve performance with async handlers
2. **Log enrichment**: Add automatic context from request/response
3. **Log sampling**: Reduce volume for high-frequency logs
4. **Security filtering**: Automatic redaction of sensitive data
5. **Advanced analytics**: Integration with machine learning for anomaly detection

## Conclusion

The enhanced logging system provides a robust foundation for monitoring and troubleshooting AI_BackLog_Assistant. With structured logging, automatic rotation, and external integration, it enables comprehensive observability of the system.
