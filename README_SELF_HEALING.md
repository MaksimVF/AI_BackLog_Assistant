# Self-Healing Capabilities

## Overview

The AI BackLog Assistant now includes comprehensive self-healing capabilities that enable the system to automatically detect and resolve issues without human intervention. This document outlines the self-healing features, architecture, and implementation details.

## Key Features

### 1. Automatic Resource Optimization

- **CPU Optimization**: Automatically identifies and terminates non-critical CPU-intensive processes
- **Memory Optimization**: Clears system caches and restarts memory-intensive services
- **Disk Optimization**: Cleans up temporary files, logs, and application caches

### 2. Process Management

- **Zombie Process Cleanup**: Identifies and terminates zombie/defunct processes
- **Process Count Monitoring**: Detects and resolves high process count situations
- **Service Restart**: Automatically restarts failed or unresponsive services

### 3. Automatic Scaling

- **CPU Scaling**: Adds/removes CPU resources based on load
- **Memory Scaling**: Increases/decreases memory allocation as needed
- **Disk Scaling**: Expands storage capacity when usage exceeds thresholds

### 4. Failover Capabilities

- **Service Failover**: Automatically switches to backup instances when primary services fail
- **Graceful Degradation**: Maintains core functionality during partial system failures

### 5. Confirmation System

- **Multi-channel Notifications**: Sends confirmations via email, Slack, and other messaging systems
- **Audit Trail**: Maintains logs of all self-healing actions taken

## Architecture

The self-healing system is built on top of the existing monitoring infrastructure:

```
[MonitoringAgent] → [SelfHealingAgent] → [NotificationAgent]
                     ↑         ↓
               [SuperAdminAgent] ← [ServiceCoordinatorAgent]
```

### Key Components

1. **SelfHealingAgent**: Core component that performs automatic recovery actions
2. **MonitoringAgent**: Provides real-time system metrics and health data
3. **NotificationAgent**: Sends alerts about self-healing actions taken
4. **SuperAdminAgent**: Coordinates all administrative functions including self-healing

## Implementation Details

### SelfHealingAgent

The `SelfHealingAgent` class implements the core self-healing logic:

- **check_system_health()**: Analyzes system metrics to determine if recovery actions are needed
- **perform_self_healing()**: Executes appropriate recovery actions based on detected issues
- **_optimize_cpu()**: Terminates non-critical CPU-intensive processes
- **_optimize_memory()**: Clears caches and manages memory usage
- **_optimize_disk()**: Cleans up temporary files and old logs
- **restart_service()**: Restarts failed or unresponsive services
- **trigger_failover()**: Initiates failover for critical services
- **auto_scale_resources()**: Adjusts resource allocation based on demand

### Configuration

Self-healing thresholds and intervals can be configured via the agent's configuration:

```python
config = {
    'cpu_critical': 95.0,          # CPU usage threshold for critical action
    'memory_critical': 95.0,       # Memory usage threshold for critical action
    'disk_critical': 90.0,         # Disk usage threshold for critical action
    'process_count_max': 1000,     # Maximum allowed process count
    'cache_cleanup_interval': 86400, # Cache cleanup interval (seconds)
    'temp_file_cleanup_interval': 43200 # Temp file cleanup interval (seconds)
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Self-Healing Check

```python
from agents.super_admin_agent import SuperAdminAgent

admin = SuperAdminAgent()

# Check if self-healing is needed
health_check = admin.check_self_healing()
print(f"Actions needed: {len(health_check['actions_needed'])}")

# Perform automatic recovery
if health_check['actions_needed']:
    results = admin.perform_self_healing()
    print(f"Actions taken: {len(results['actions_taken'])}")
```

### Service Management

```python
# Restart a service
result = admin.restart_service("database_service")
print(f"Service restart: {result['status']}")

# Trigger failover
failover_result = admin.trigger_failover("primary_database")
print(f"Failover: {failover_result['status']}")
```

### Resource Scaling

```python
# Scale memory
scale_result = admin.auto_scale_resources("memory", 4)
print(f"Memory scaling: {scale_result['status']}")

# Scale CPU
cpu_result = admin.auto_scale_resources("cpu", 2)
print(f"CPU scaling: {cpu_result['status']}")
```

## Alerting and Notifications

The system sends alerts when critical self-healing actions are taken:

- **Critical Actions**: Immediate notifications via all configured channels
- **Warning Actions**: Notifications sent with lower priority
- **Maintenance Actions**: Logged for audit purposes

Example alert:
```
[SELF_HEALING] Action taken: memory_optimization - Cleared system caches
```

## Benefits

1. **Improved System Reliability**: Automatic recovery from common failure scenarios
2. **Reduced Downtime**: Faster response to issues than manual intervention
3. **Cost Optimization**: Efficient resource utilization through automatic scaling
4. **Operational Efficiency**: Reduces the need for 24/7 human monitoring
5. **Proactive Maintenance**: Scheduled cleanup and optimization tasks

## Future Enhancements

1. **Machine Learning Integration**: Predictive analytics for proactive issue detection
2. **Extended Resource Management**: Support for additional resource types (GPU, network)
3. **Custom Recovery Scripts**: User-defined recovery actions for specific scenarios
4. **Web Dashboard**: Visual interface for monitoring self-healing activities
5. **Multi-cloud Support**: Resource scaling across different cloud providers

## Conclusion

The self-healing capabilities significantly enhance the robustness and reliability of the AI BackLog Assistant. By automatically detecting and resolving issues, the system can maintain optimal performance with minimal human intervention, reducing downtime and operational costs.
