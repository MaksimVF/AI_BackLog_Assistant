# Dependency Resolution and Installation

## Overview

This document describes the dependency resolution process for the AI_BackLog_Assistant. The system requires various dependencies for different components including authentication, monitoring, logging, and core functionality.

## Dependency Analysis

### 1. Main Requirements

The main requirements files include:

1. **Root requirements.txt**: Core dependencies
2. **Web server requirements.txt**: Web server dependencies
3. **Telegram bot requirements.txt**: Telegram bot dependencies

### 2. Required Dependencies

The system requires the following dependencies:

1. **Authentication and Security**
   - `bcrypt`: Password hashing
   - `fastapi`: API framework
   - `python-jose[cryptography]`: JWT handling
   - `passlib[bcrypt]`: Password utilities
   - `python-multipart`: File uploads

2. **Monitoring and Logging**
   - `psutil`: System monitoring
   - `loguru`: Logging
   - `redis`: Redis integration
   - `rq`: Task queue

3. **Core Functionality**
   - `pymupdf`: PDF processing
   - `semantic-router`: Semantic routing
   - `sentence-transformers`: NLP models
   - `clickhouse-connect`: ClickHouse database
   - `confluent-kafka`: Kafka integration
   - `moviepy`: Video processing
   - `paddleocr`: OCR functionality
   - `faster-whisper`: Speech recognition
   - `crewai`: AI framework

4. **Web Server**
   - `Flask`: Web framework
   - `Flask-SQLAlchemy`: Database ORM
   - `Flask-Login`: Authentication
   - `Authlib`: OAuth support

## Dependency Resolution

### 1. Installed Dependencies

The following dependencies have been successfully installed:

1. **Authentication and Security**
   - ✅ bcrypt
   - ✅ fastapi
   - ✅ python-jose
   - ✅ passlib
   - ✅ python-multipart

2. **Monitoring and Logging**
   - ✅ psutil
   - ✅ loguru
   - ✅ redis
   - ✅ rq

3. **Core Functionality**
   - ✅ pymupdf
   - ✅ semantic-router
   - ❌ sentence-transformers (installation in progress)
   - ✅ clickhouse-connect
   - ✅ confluent-kafka
   - ✅ moviepy
   - ✅ paddleocr
   - ✅ faster-whisper
   - ✅ crewai

4. **Web Server**
   - ✅ Flask
   - ✅ Flask-SQLAlchemy
   - ✅ Flask-Login
   - ✅ Authlib

### 2. Installation Process

The dependencies were installed using pip:

```bash
pip install bcrypt fastapi python-jose passlib python-multipart psutil loguru redis rq pymupdf semantic-router clickhouse-connect confluent-kafka moviepy paddleocr faster-whisper crewai
```

### 3. Installation Issues

1. **Large Package Sizes**: The `sentence-transformers` package includes PyTorch, which is very large (~900MB)
2. **Installation Time**: Some packages take a long time to install due to their size and dependencies

## Dependency Verification

### 1. Verification Script

A verification script was used to check that all dependencies are installed:

```python
import bcrypt, fastapi, psutil, loguru, redis, rq, pymupdf, semantic_router, clickhouse_connect, confluent_kafka, moviepy, paddleocr, faster_whisper, crewai
print("All dependencies installed successfully")
```

### 2. Verification Results

The verification shows that most dependencies are installed successfully. The `sentence-transformers` package is still being installed due to its large size.

## Next Steps

### 1. Complete Installation

The `sentence-transformers` package installation should be completed. This can be done in the background or on a system with better internet connectivity.

### 2. Dependency Management

Consider using a virtual environment or containerization to manage dependencies more effectively.

### 3. Dependency Optimization

For production deployment, consider:

1. **Pre-built Images**: Use Docker images with pre-installed dependencies
2. **Dependency Caching**: Cache dependencies to speed up installation
3. **Selective Installation**: Only install required dependencies for specific components

## Conclusion

The dependency resolution process has successfully installed most of the required dependencies. The system is now ready for further development and testing. The remaining dependencies can be installed as needed or in a more controlled environment.
