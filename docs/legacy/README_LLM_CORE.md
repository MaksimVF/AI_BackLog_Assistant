## Overview

The LLM Core is the central intelligence module of the AI BackLog Assistant system. It serves as the brain that coordinates all agent activities, handles reflections, manages self-improvement, and facilitates decision-making.

## Key Features

1. **Agent Command Processing** - Handles all types of agent commands
2. **Reflection and Analysis** - Performs deep analysis of input data
3. **Self-Improvement** - Identifies areas for improvement and generates action plans
4. **Decision Making** - Coordinates routing and task prioritization
5. **Memory Management** - Stores and retrieves processing history
6. **Performance Monitoring** - Tracks metrics and system health

## Architecture

The LLM Core follows a modular architecture with two main implementations:

### 1. Full Implementation (`llm_core.py`)

- Integrates with existing system components
- Uses advanced reflection agents, memory systems, and pipeline coordinators
- Requires external dependencies (Redis, Weaviate, etc.)

### 2. Standalone Implementation (`llm_core_standalone.py`)

- Self-contained version with no external dependencies
- Uses simplified components for testing and development
- Ideal for quick prototyping and isolated testing

## Core Components

### AgentCommand
Standard format for all agent commands:
- `command_type`: Type of command (process, analyze, route, reflect, improve, coordinate)
- `agent_id`: Identifier of the requesting agent
- `payload`: Command-specific data
- `priority`: Command priority (high, medium, low)

### AgentResponse
Standard format for all agent responses:
- `status`: Response status (success, failure, partial)
- `result`: Command processing results
- `error`: Error message (if applicable)
- `timestamp`: Response timestamp

### SelfImprovementPlan
Structure for self-improvement recommendations:
- `areas_for_improvement`: List of identified weak areas
- `recommended_actions`: Specific actions to address improvements
- `priority`: Improvement priority
- `deadline`: Optional deadline for implementation

## Command Types

1. **Process** - Process raw input data through pipelines
2. **Analyze** - Perform deep analysis of text content
3. **Route** - Determine appropriate agent for handling
4. **Reflect** - Perform self-reflection and generate insights
5. **Improve** - Generate and execute self-improvement plans
6. **Coordinate** - Coordinate multiple agents for complex tasks

## Usage Examples

### Basic Initialization

```python
from agents.llm_core_standalone import LLMCore, LLMCoreConfig, AgentCommand

# Initialize with debug mode
core = LLMCore(config=LLMCoreConfig(debug_mode=True))
```

### Processing Text

```python
command = AgentCommand(
    command_type='process',
    agent_id='user_agent',
    payload={
        'input_type': 'text',
        'data': 'Analyze this important document'
    }
)

response = core.process_command(command)
print(response.result)
```

### Text Analysis

```python
command = AgentCommand(
    command_type='analyze',
    agent_id='research_agent',
    payload={
        'text': 'How can we improve system performance?'
    }
)

response = core.process_command(command)
print(f"Context: {response.result['context']}")
print(f"Intent: {response.result['intent']}")
```

### Routing

```python
command = AgentCommand(
    command_type='route',
    agent_id='router_agent',
    payload={
        'text': 'We need to analyze this contract urgently'
    }
)

response = core.process_command(command)
print(f"Next agent: {response.result['next_agent']}")
```

## Performance Monitoring

The LLM Core tracks key performance metrics:
- Total commands processed
- Success/failure rates
- Average processing time
- Command history

```python
metrics = core.get_performance_metrics()
print(f"Success rate: {metrics['metrics']['success_count']}/{metrics['metrics']['total_commands']}")
```

## Self-Improvement

The core automatically identifies areas for improvement and generates action plans:

```python
command = AgentCommand(
    command_type='reflect',
    agent_id='self_improvement_agent',
    payload={
        'text': 'The system is struggling with complex queries'
    }
)

response = core.process_command(command)
if response.result['improvement_plan']:
    print("Improvement areas:", response.result['improvement_plan']['areas_for_improvement'])
```

## Testing

Two test scripts are provided:

1. `test_llm_core.py` - Tests the full implementation
2. `test_llm_core_standalone.py` - Tests the standalone implementation

Run tests with:
```bash
python test_llm_core_standalone.py
```

## Integration

To integrate the LLM Core into your system:

1. Choose the appropriate implementation (full or standalone)
2. Initialize the core with your configuration
3. Send commands using the `AgentCommand` format
4. Process responses using the `AgentResponse` format
5. Monitor performance and self-improvement recommendations

## Future Enhancements

1. **Advanced Memory Integration** - Better integration with long-term memory systems
2. **Enhanced Self-Improvement** - Automatic execution of improvement actions
3. **Multi-Agent Coordination** - More sophisticated agent team management
4. **Real-time Monitoring** - Dashboard for system health and performance
5. **Adaptive Learning** - Continuous improvement based on usage patterns

## Conclusion

The LLM Core provides a robust foundation for building intelligent agent systems. Its modular design allows for easy integration with existing components while the standalone version enables rapid development and testing.
