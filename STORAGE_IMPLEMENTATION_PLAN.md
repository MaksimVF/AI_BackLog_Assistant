# Storage Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the phased implementation plan for enhancing storage management with administrative control over pricing, quotas, and flexible storage options.

## Stage 1: Storage Pricing Model and Admin Interface
**Goal**: Implement storage pricing configuration and basic admin interface

1. **Create StoragePricing model**
   - Implement the StoragePricing model in `billing_models.py`
   - Add database migration

2. **Admin route for storage pricing**
   - Implement `/admin/storage/pricing` endpoint in `admin_routes.py`
   - Basic GET/POST functionality

3. **Basic admin template**
   - Create simple storage pricing form in `admin/storage_pricing.html`

## Stage 2: User Storage Quotas
**Goal**: Add storage quota management to user model and admin interface

1. **Extend User model**
   - Add storage quota fields to User model in `models.py`
   - Add database migration

2. **Admin route for user quotas**
   - Implement `/admin/storage/quotas` endpoint in `admin_routes.py`
   - Basic GET/POST functionality

## Stage 3: Tariff Plan Integration
**Goal**: Integrate storage options with tariff plans

1. **Extend TariffPlan model**
   - Add storage fields to TariffPlan model in `billing_models.py`
   - Add database migration

2. **Admin route for tariff plans**
   - Implement `/admin/tariffs` endpoint in `admin_routes.py`
   - Basic GET/POST functionality

## Stage 4: One-time Storage Purchase API
**Goal**: Implement API for users to purchase additional storage

1. **Implement purchase endpoint**
   - Add `/api/v1/storage/purchase` endpoint in `document_routes.py`
   - Implement cost calculation and balance deduction logic

## Stage 5: UI Enhancements
**Goal**: Improve admin interface with better templates and JavaScript

1. **Enhanced storage pricing template**
   - Improve the storage pricing form with better validation
   - Add JavaScript for form submission

2. **User quota management interface**
   - Create template for managing user storage quotas

## Stage 6: Billing Integration and Enforcement
**Goal**: Complete the integration with billing system and storage policy enforcement

1. **Billing system integration**
   - Update billing system to track storage costs
   - Implement storage cost calculation

2. **Storage policy enforcement**
   - Implement background job for storage cleanup
   - Add expiration handling
