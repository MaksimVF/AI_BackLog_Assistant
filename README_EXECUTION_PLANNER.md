# Execution Planner Agent

## Overview

The Execution Planner Agent is a logical extension of the Decision Agent, designed to handle task execution planning after decisions have been made. It provides comprehensive planning capabilities for tasks that have been recommended, deferred, or rejected.

## Purpose

After the Decision Agent makes a final decision (recommend, postpone, reject), the Execution Planner Agent addresses the following needs:

- **For recommended tasks**: Determine who, when, and how the task will be executed
- **For deferred tasks**: Set conditions or time for revisiting the task
- **For rejected tasks**: Log justification and complete the cycle

## Architecture

The Execution Planner Agent follows a modular architecture with multiple specialized sub-agents:

### Sub-Agents

1. **TimelineEstimator** (`timeline_estimator.py`)
   - Estimates task completion timeline based on effort, priority, and criticality
   - Provides initial duration estimates

2. **DeadlineCalculator** (`deadline_calculator.py`)
   - Calculates precise deadlines considering working hours and days
   - Handles effort-to-time conversion

3. **SchedulingIntegrator** (`scheduling_integrator.py`)
   - Creates structured task objects for scheduling systems
   - Integrates with external systems (Trello, Jira, Notion, etc.)

4. **FollowUpNotifier** (`followup_notifier.py`)
   - Sets reminders and checkpoints based on task decision
   - Creates mid-review and deadline reminders

5. **DependencyDetector** (`dependency_detector.py`)
   - Analyzes task dependencies from description and metadata
   - Identifies blocking tasks and external dependencies

6. **RiskClassifier** (`risk_classifier.py`)
   - Identifies and classifies potential risks
   - Analyzes technical, external, resource, and time risks

7. **FinalDecisionMaker** (`final_decision_maker.py`)
   - Makes final execution decision based on all factors
   - Provides reasoning for the decision

### Main Agent

**ExecutionPlannerAgent** (`execution_planner_agent.py`)
- Main integration class that coordinates all sub-agents
- Creates comprehensive execution plans
- Handles both individual and batch task planning

## Usage Example

```python
from agents.execution_planner.execution_planner_agent import ExecutionPlannerAgent
from datetime import datetime

# Create execution planner agent
planner = ExecutionPlannerAgent()

# Sample task data
task = {
    "task_id": "task_1",
    "title": "Critical security fix",
    "description": "Fix critical vulnerability in authentication system",
    "priority": "high",
    "criticality": "high",
    "estimated_effort_days": 2,
    "effort_hours": 12,
    "dependencies": ["task_102"],
    "stakeholders": ["security_team"],
    "assigned_to": "security_lead",
    "category": "Security",
    "priority_score": 8.5,
    "strategic_alignment": True
}

# Decision from DecisionAgent
decision = "recommend"

# Create execution plan
execution_plan = planner.plan_execution(task, decision)

print(f"Final Decision: {execution_plan['final_decision']['decision']}")
print(f"Reason: {execution_plan['final_decision']['reason']}")
print(f"Estimated Duration: {execution_plan['timeline_estimation']['estimated_duration_days']} days")
print(f"Deadline: {execution_plan['deadline_calculation']['deadline_date']}")
print(f"Dependencies: {execution_plan['dependency_analysis']}")
print(f"Risks: {execution_plan['risk_assessment']}")
print(f"Follow-ups: {execution_plan['followup_notifications']}")
```

## Execution Planning Process

1. **Timeline Estimation**: Initial duration estimate based on effort, priority, and criticality
2. **Deadline Calculation**: Precise deadline considering working hours and days
3. **Dependency Detection**: Analysis of task dependencies and blockers
4. **Risk Classification**: Identification of potential risks
5. **Final Decision Making**: Comprehensive decision based on all factors
6. **Scheduling Integration**: Creation of structured task objects
7. **Follow-up Notifications**: Setup of reminders and checkpoints

## Integration Capabilities

The Execution Planner Agent can integrate with:
- Project management systems (GitHub Projects, Jira, Trello, ClickUp)
- Automation systems (Execution Engine)
- Custom execution scenarios based on team or product needs

## Testing

The `test_execution_planner.py` provides comprehensive test cases demonstrating:
- Individual task execution planning
- Batch execution planning
- Integration of all sub-agents

## Benefits

1. **Comprehensive Planning**: Considers all aspects of task execution
2. **Modular Architecture**: Easy to extend with additional sub-agents
3. **Transparent Process**: Clear reporting of all planning factors
4. **Integration Ready**: Designed for integration with external systems
5. **Team-Focused**: Supports team-based execution planning

## Implementation Notes

- The Execution Planner Agent is designed to work after the Decision Agent
- It's placed in a separate directory to indicate it's for team/group usage
- The modular architecture allows for easy extension and customization
- All sub-agents can be independently improved or replaced

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with actual calendar systems
- Advanced dependency management
- Resource availability checking
- Historical performance analysis for better estimation
- Machine learning for improved risk classification
