- API endpoints for document upload and processing
- Integration with the pipeline system
- Web interface for managing projects and analytics

## Features

   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Set environment variables:
   ```bash
   export SECRET_KEY='your-secret-key-here'
   export DATABASE_URI='sqlite:///site.db'
   ```

### Running the Server
